# DoMore (TODO) App

## Project Description
A modern TODO app designed to help you organize your tasks efficiently. Built with a responsive UI that adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes. The project, inspired by a challenge from [FrontendMentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW), is responsive across various screen sizes. Leveraging Flexbox and media queries, the design ensures an optimal user experience. Additionally, the drag and drop functionality is achieved through JavaScript. Adding a button to switch between light and dark themes

- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- JavaScript

### What I Learned
During this project, I gained insights into various technologies and faced new challenges:
- Implementing responsive design with Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Integrating webkit animation for loading effects
- Learning and implementing drag and drop functionality using React
- Implementing light and dark theme
- Adding a button to switch between light and dark themes

### Continued development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
